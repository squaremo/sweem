// Why use this instead of pipe?

var socket = net.createConnection("localhost", 5000);
socket.setEncoding('utf8');
var file = fs.createWriteStream("/tmp/alerts");

// With stream proxying:
var filtered = partition(socket, function(data) { return /^prefix/.test(data); });
filtered.pipe(file);

// With pipes
var filtered = new PartitionStream(function(data) { return /^prefix/.test(data); });
socket.pipe(filtered);
filtered.pipe(file);

// NB In both cases filtered must be flip writes to emits. In both
// cases back-pressure may be propagated: the implementation of pipe
// will help with this in the second case (but of course pipe can
// simply be done behind the scenes in the first anyway).

// One nice feature of the first approach is that it's "chainable",
// that is, one could write

partition(socket, /^prefix/)
  .transform(function(data) { return data.substring(6); })
  .pipe(file);

// Mind you, pipe returns the destination stream, so one can do

socket.pipe(new PartitionStream(/^prefix/))
  .pipe(new TransformStream(function(data) { return data.substring(6); }))
  .pipe(file);

// but I don't think it's as nice. Perhaps both can be provided.  One
// major problem with pipe is that it won't deal with multiple
// arguments; possibly that is breaking the contract, in which case,
// the proxy streams ought really to have another interface:

new Source(socket)
    .filter(/^prefix/)
    .transform(function(d) {...})
    .sink(file);

// where Sink does something if it gets more than one data argument --
// perhaps just drops any others.

// Another example, this time using join

new Join(socket1, socket2)
    // go from d1, d2, to {'d1': d1, 'd2': d2}
    .lift('d1', 'd2')
    .tojson()
    .sink(file);

// Can I do this:

new Source(socket1).join(socket2, socket3)
// (sure why not, but it's not nice)

// *** Maybe it would be easier to cons arrays and send those as the
// representation of tuples, rather than using multiple arguments,
// which cause a bit of pain (lots of consing, and reimplementing pipe
// etc.).

// ====

// destruct:
var parts = strimz(net.connect(5000)).match(/^prefix(.*)/);

// partition_into or split pipes two ways:

source(alerts).split(/^ERROR/, process.stderr, process.stdout);

// can this be generalised ..

source(alerts).split(/^WARNING/, process.stdout,
                     /^ERROR/, process.stderr,
                     true, fs.createWriteStream("/tmp/log"));

// fold

// running total .. any useful examples?
source(numbers).fold(function(accum, d) { return accum + d; }, 0);

// signals v events

// a sample every five seconds
source(net.connect(5000)).sample({'seconds': 5});

// a sample every ten events
source(net.connect(5000)).sample({'events': 10});

// send tick every five seconds
every(5000, "tick");

// gate (send left stream, or both, when right stream has a value,
// discard otherwise)

// case -- destructing patterns with multiple pipes

// --- parsing

// Parsing frames from some stream. sweem with bitsyntax could be
// helpful:

var frames = sweem(socket).frames('len:8, data:len');

// which is: match the pattern given against the data stream; if it
// doesn't match, wait for another data event before trying again with
// the concatenated buffers. Emit a frame when one matches.
//
// Probably best to provide two procedures: one to try a parse, one to
// accumulate values. Can this be built from other primitives?

sweem(socket).frames(BITS.compile('len:8, data:len'), consBuffers);

// Difficulty: how to determine what the rest is.
// Possibly use {value: _, rest_} | false
// as I did with msgpack.

// ==== SIGNALS

// A signal is a value. Default behaviour is to take an event stream
// and just overwrite; but this isn't the only
// behaviour. signal.changes can be used to convert back to an event
// stream; likewise, signal.sample(...).

// A URL is a signal too that can be sampled (but, 'changes'?). Or
// maybe there's just `sampleUrl`.

// Differentiate a signal.

// A window is a signal with some extra gubbins like sum.

// === DEDUP

// Deduplication, grouping, explicit and implicit timestamp windows

var entries = url('http://example.com/blog.atom').split(function(entire) {
  return xpath(entire, '//atom:entry');
}).dedup({unique: function(entry) { return xpath(entry, '//atom:id'); },
          lwm: function(entry) { return xpath(entry, '//atom:timestamp');}});

// that is, split the polled data into entries, extract the timestamp
// from each and treat it as a time value, and keep a deduplication
// buffer using a low-water mark. The latter means reject anything
// older than the low water mark -- effectively this means no
// pre-dated entries.

// Other options: keep a window of a certain size, using either
// implicit timestamps (when it arrives) or explicit timestamps.

entries.dedup({unique: function(entry) { return xpath(entry, '//atom:id'); },
               timestamp: function(entry) { return xpath(entry, '//atom:timestamp') },
               window: {hours: 2}});

entries.dedup({unique: function(entry) { return xpath(entry, '//atom:id'); },
               timestamp: Date,
               window: {hours: 2}});

// (probably should figure out a grammar for this)

// === RELIABILITY

// See Storm, it's not a bad model. Essentially, a reference to the
// origin is kept, and once a tuple has propagated all the way through
// a tree, it's acked. The trick is in the details of "all the way
// through a tree".
